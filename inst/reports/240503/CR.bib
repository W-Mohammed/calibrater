Evolution of the methods since the first ISPOR Modeling Task Force  reported in 2003 has led to a new Task Force, jointly convened with the Society  for Medical Decision Making, and this series of seven articles presents the  updated recommendations for best practices in conceptualizing models;  implementing state-transition approaches, discrete event simulations, or dynamic  transmission models; and dealing with uncertainty and validating and reporting  models transparently. This overview article introduces the work of the Task  Force, provides all the recommendations, and discusses some quandaries that  require further elucidation. The audience for these articles includes those who  build models, stakeholders who utilize their results, and, indeed, anyone  concerned with the use of models to support decision making.},

  abstract = {Public health interventions tend to be complex, programmatic, and context dependent. The evidence for their effectiveness must be sufficiently  comprehensive to encompass that complexity. This paper asks whether and to what  extent evaluative research on public health interventions can be adequately  appraised by applying well established criteria for judging the quality of  evidence in clinical practice. It is adduced that these criteria are useful in  evaluating some aspects of evidence. However, there are other important aspects  of evidence on public health interventions that are not covered by the  established criteria. The evaluation of evidence must distinguish between the  fidelity of the evaluation process in detecting the success or failure of an  intervention, and the success or failure of the intervention itself. Moreover, if  an intervention is unsuccessful, the evidence should help to determine whether  the intervention was inherently faulty (that is, failure of intervention concept  or theory), or just badly delivered (failure of implementation). Furthermore,  proper interpretation of the evidence depends upon the availability of  descriptive information on the intervention and its context, so that the  transferability of the evidence can be determined. Study design alone is an  inadequate marker of evidence quality in public health intervention evaluation.},
